    <p>This was my first time using Python to build something realâ€”a puzzle game! I learned how to use `while` loops, `if` statements, and even built a hint system. It started as a school challenge, but ended up being something I wanted to keep improving.</p>
    <p>Next, I want to add sound effects and a score tracker. Maybe even let people play online!</p>
